# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native fails to render data fetched successfully from a remote API.  The application fetches data correctly, but the FlatList remains empty after the loading indicator disappears.

## Bug Description

The `DataFetch` component uses `useEffect` to fetch data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint.  While the API call succeeds, and the data is correctly stored in the component's state, the `FlatList` component doesn't update and remain empty.  The loading indicator disappears, indicating the API call completed, but no data is displayed.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `data` prop of the `FlatList` is not null or undefined. This can be achieved by checking the data length before rendering.  In the provided solution, added a check to display a message if the data array is empty after the API call completes.
